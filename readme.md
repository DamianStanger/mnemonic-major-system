# My mnemonic major system is thus:

| number | Letter(s) | description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | z, s, soft c | "z" is the first letter of zero. The others have a similar sound |
| 1 | l            | Looks like a 1 |
| 2 | n            | n has two downstrokes. |
| 3 | m            | three downstrokes, also "3" looks like "m" on its side |
| 4 | r            | last letter of four |
| 5 | f, v         | Five begins with a f |
| 6 | b, p         | b looks like 6, p sounds similar |
| 7 | d, t, th                 |  |
| 8 | j, sh, ch, soft g        | g looks a little like an 8 when written in a script style |
| 9 | k, hard c, hard g, q, qu | q looks like a 9 |
